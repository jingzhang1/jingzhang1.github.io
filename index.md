I am Jing Zhang, a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/">Department of Population and Quantitative Health Science</a>, <a href="https://case.edu/">Case Western Reserve University</a>. 


My PhD research focuses on developing statistical methods for brain functional MRI imaging data,
aimed at improving the quantification of uncertainty in dynamic functional connectivity. This work
is pivotal in helping accurate statistical inference for the dynamically changing brain connectivity
and is crucial for guiding surgeons in brain tumor resection decisions. My Master study's research is at
the intersection of spatial statistics and infectious disease. I use spatial statistics for the detection of
spatial clusters of infectious disease and investigate the risk factors for the treatment outcome of
tuberculosis.


Besides my thesis work, I have over 7 years of experience in collaboration work as a Research
Assistant in Biostatistics. I have hands-on experience in statistical analysis of various types of
studies, such as a cross-sectional study of human vagus nerve, a longitudinal analysis of myopia
surgery, and a Phase III clinical trial of gastric cancer. I also participate in the study designs for the
grant proposal, such as an NIH contract ($15.75 million) for mapping the human vagus nerve, an
NIH STTR grant for intra-operative fMRI during brain tumor surgery, and a Phase I clinical trial of
pancreatic cancer. These collaborations have enhanced my ability to communicate statistical
concepts and study design considerations effectively with medical professionals.
