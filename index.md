  I am Jing Zhang, a first year PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at <a href="http://epbiwww.case.edu/">Department of Population and Quantative Health Science</a>, <a href="https://case.edu/">Case Western Reserve University</a>. 
   
  During the study of Master of Science in Biostatistics in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>, I was fortunately supervised by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henry_Lynn2"> Prof. Henry S Lynn</a> and also work with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=xq-7QVQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"> Prof. Zhijie Zhang</a>.   
  
  I am broadly interested in statistical methodology and application in public health. Some of my interests are
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Spatial statistics, eg. spatially varying coefficient models; </li>
  <li> Propensity score estimation, eg. robustness to uncontrolled confounders; </li>   
  <li> Infectious disease modelling and epidemiology, especially tuberculosis; </li>
  <li> Clinical trials design and analysis </li>
  </ul>
