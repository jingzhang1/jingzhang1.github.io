### Brain tumor patient functional connectivity and its test-retest reliability during awake and anesthesia        
*	Comparing the functional connectivity and its test-retest reliability between awake and anesthesia
*	Using developed variance estimation method for dynamic functional connectivity
Variance estimation for dynamic functional connectivity 						              2022-23
*	A variance estimator for sliding window correlation, considering varying window autocorrelation and cross-correlation
*	Window size recommendation for varying window; Dynamic connectivity detection based on confidence interval

### Early stopping rule for real-time fMRI dynamic experimentation through forecasting                                                 2020-21
*	Forecasted fMRI signal by bootstrap aggregation (bagging) ARIMA model using STL Decomposition and Box-Cox Transformation 
*	Supported the early stopping rule of real-time fMRI dynamic experimentation

### Simulation-based comparisons between generalized spatially varying coefficient models                                             2018-19
*	Generated varying-coefficient simulation data based on logistic distribution, according to disease occurrence 
*	Compared the performance of generalized geographically weighted regression under different distributions
*	Applied the result to tuberculosis in Shanghai, and Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease in 7 provinces in China

### Effects of spatial autocorrelation and hospitals on tuberculosis treatment outcome: An implication of tuberculosis control in a highly integrated city                                                                                                                                                                 2017-18
*	Explored risk factors for poor tuberculosis treatment outcome in Shanghai, in both individual level and spatial aspect
*	Found the effects of spatial autocorrelation and designated hospital on treatment outcome and the biased estimation of other risk factors if spatial information was ignored
*	Visualized the preference of patients in treatment hospitals and gave constructive suggestions to the government

### A Simulation on the Effectiveness of the Robustness Index of Propensity Score Estimation                                              2018
*	Collaborated with [Dr. Wei Pan](https://sites.duke.edu/panwei/), an associate professor at Duke University on the simulation-based study to prove the effectiveness of the robustness index in the presence of uncontrolled confounders
*	Implemented the robustness index, probability values and percentage points for Pearson distributions in R 
*	Improved the method by augmenting the sampling space and bootstrap
