### Brain tumor patient functional connectivity and its test-retest reliability during awake and anesthesia        
*	Comparing the functional connectivity and its test-retest reliability between awake and anesthesia
*	Using the developed variance estimation method for dynamic functional connectivity
*	Poster at International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine ([ISMRM](https://www.ismrm.org/24m/)), Singapore, May 2024

### Variance estimation for dynamic functional connectivity 						             
*	A variance estimator for sliding window correlation, considering varying window autocorrelation and cross-correlation
*	Window size recommendation for varying window; Dynamic connectivity detection based on confidence interval
*	Oral presentation at Eastern North American Region ([ENAR](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2024/)), Baltimore, MD, US, March 2024

### Early stopping rule for real-time fMRI dynamic experimentation through forecasting                             
*	Forecasted fMRI signal by bootstrap aggregation (bagging) ARIMA model using STL Decomposition and Box-Cox Transformation 
*	Supported the early stopping rule of real-time fMRI dynamic experimentation
*	[Publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643740/full), Poster at 7th Annual [BRAIN Initiative Meeting](https://www.braininitiative.org/achievements/the-7th-annual-brain-initiative-investigators-meeting/), Virtual, June 2021

### Simulation-based comparisons between generalized spatially varying coefficient models                          
*	Generated varying-coefficient simulation data based on logistic distribution, according to disease occurrence 
*	Compared the performance of generalized geographically weighted regression under different distributions
*	Applied the result to tuberculosis in Shanghai, and Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease in 7 provinces in China

### Effects of spatial autocorrelation and hospitals on tuberculosis treatment outcome: An implication of tuberculosis control in a highly integrated city                                                                   
*	Explored risk factors for poor tuberculosis treatment outcome in Shanghai, in both individual level and spatial aspect
*	Found the effects of spatial autocorrelation and designated hospital on treatment outcome and the biased estimation of other risk factors if spatial information was ignored
*	Visualized the preferences of patients in treatment hospitals and gave constructive suggestions to the government
*	[Publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684007/)

### A Simulation on the Effectiveness of the Robustness Index of Propensity Score Estimation                       
*	Collaborated with [Dr. Wei Pan](https://sites.duke.edu/panwei/), an associate professor at Duke University on the simulation-based study to prove the effectiveness of the robustness index in the presence of uncontrolled confounders
*	Implemented the robustness index, probability values and percentage points for Pearson distributions in R 
*	Improved the method by augmenting the sampling space and bootstrap
