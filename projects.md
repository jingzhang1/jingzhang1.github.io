Projects I have involved are listed here. Some code and results are shared also.

### Simulation-based comparisons between generalized spatially varying coefficient models
• Generated varying-coefficient simulation data based on logistic distribution, according to disease occurrence  
• Compared generalized geographically weighted regression with Bayesian spatially varying coefficient model  
• Applied the result to tuberculosis in Shanghai, and Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease in 7 provinces in China  

### Effects of spatial autocorrelation and hospitals on tuberculosis treatment outcome: An implication of tuberculosis control in a highly integrated city  
• Explored risk factors for poor tuberculosis treatment outcome in Shanghai, in both individual level and spatial aspect  
• Found the effects of spatial autocorrelation and designated hospital on treatment outcome and the biased estimation of other risk factors if spatial information was ignored  
• Visualized the preference of patients in treatment hospitals and gave constructive suggestions to the government  

### A Simulation on the Effectiveness of the Robustness Index of Propensity Score Estimation  
• Collaborated with Dr. Wei Pan, an associate professor at Duke University on the simulation-based study to prove the effectiveness of the robustness index in the presence of uncontrolled confounders  
• Implemented the robustness index, probability values and percentage points for Pearson distributions in R  
• Improve the method by augmenting the sampling space and bootstrap  

### Statistical Analyses in Clinical Trials
• Wrote [R code](https://github.com/jingzhang1/jingzhang1.github.io/blob/master/projects/clinical_trial.md) for implementing basic statisical analyses in clinical trials
