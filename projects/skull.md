This is my dissertation research. The code is on **<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rgriff23/Dissertation">GitHub</a>**. These are my chapters:

1. Introduction
2. Collecting 3D digital data on primate skulls
3. Using n-point alignment to align digital primate crania and mandibles
4. Macroevolutionary correlates of primate skull shape
5. Macroevolutionary integration and modularity in the primate skull
6. Conclusions

Update: I successfully defended my dissertation on May 11, 2018! I'll be trying to publish chapters 3-5 over the summer and will post about these studies after that.
